<p>I am currently pursuing a computer science MSE at Johns Hopkins University in the language processing track. I am currently looking for oppurtunities to do PhD-level research in language and speech processing. My advisor is Prof. Hynek Hermansky.</p> 
<p>I obtained my BA at the University of Oxford, majoring in Mathematics and Computer Science. I had previously been part of the Fast Kernels team at Nvidia.</p>
<p>My interest lies in the intersection of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR): I believe there is untapped potential to be gained when speech and NLP are studied more closely together. Specifically, I am interested in settings with multiple domains (continual learning, federated learning, domain transfer, etc.): how to allow neural networks identify the source domain of an input sequence, learn from different domains, transfer its knowledge from one domain to another, or generate sequence in an appropriate domain. </p>
